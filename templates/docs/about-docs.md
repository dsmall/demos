## About Rascal documentation ##

Rascal documentation is written in plain text and formatted so that Markdown can render it as HTML for web browsers. Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool. The Rascal uses the [markdown2][1] library written in Python as its Markdown renderer. Markdown syntax is summarised below but best learned from the [Markdown web site][2].

### How Markdown works on the Rascal

When a file ends in `.md`, the Rascal sends it through a Markdown processor before displaying it.  When you view a Markdown page in a web browser, your Rascal renders the Markdown into the template `documentation.html`. You can edit this template in any way you like, provided that you retain
the following [Jinja2][3] variable, which receives the formatted HTML:

    {{ markdown|safe }}

For example, you might want to edit `templates/documentation.html` to change the default style.

### Adding a docs tab ###

In addition to using Markdown for standalone documentation, you can also add a **Docs** button to your templates. Clicking the Docs button slides out a documentation tab whose content is formatted using Markdown.
For an example, see the [sprinkler][4] demo.

Adding a Docs tab to a new template involves three steps:

1. When creating a new template, choose the option "HTML with Docs tab"
2. View your new template in a browser and click its Docs tab
3. Follow the instructions in the tab for creating the documentation template.

To add a Docs tab to an existing HTML template, uncomment the line:

    <!-- {% include "include/doc-tab.html" %} --> 

by changing it to:

    {% include "include/doc-tab.html" %} 

If you want to add a Docs tab to an existing template, create a new temporary template
as in step 1, copy the line above into the corresponding position in your older template, and then
continue at step 2 with your template. The instructions for creating Docs tab
content can also be found [here][5].

## Markdown Examples ##
It is best to view this section both in the editor to see the Markdown source and in a web browser
to see the rendered result. The source file can be found at `templates/docs/about-docs.md`.

### Formatted Text ###
The subtitle above begins with `###` which generates an `<h3>` tag
##### Beginning a line with `#####` generates an `<h5>` tag

Separate paragraphs with a blank line.

Nullam quis risus eget urna mollis ornare vel eu leo.
Cum sociis natoque penatibus et magnis dis parturient montes, nascetur ridiculus mus.
Nullam id dolor id nibh ultricies vehicula.

Enclose a word or phrase with a single `_` for _italic_ and double `**` for **bold**.
You can also use `*` for _italic_ and `__` for __bold__.

*These can be combined to put **bold words** in an italic sentence* (or vice versa).

### Lists ###
You can create unordered lists:

* Apples
* Pears
* Berries
    * Raspberries
    * Strawberries

or ordered lists:

1. One potato
2. Two potatoes
3. Three potatoes
4. Four

### Block Quotes ###
Begin block quotes with the greater than character `>`:

> "But the doctrine of the Farm is merely this, that every man ought to stand in primary relations with the work of the world, ought to do it himself, and not to suffer the accident of his having a purse in his pocket, or his having been bred to some dishonorable and injurious craft, to sever him from those duties; and for this reason, that labor is God's education; that he only is a sincere learner, he only can become a master, who learns the secrets of labor, and who by real cunning extorts from nature its sceptre."

### Links and Images ###

### Code Examples ###
You can include a block of code by indenting with four spaces.
The following is the code in `server.py` that renders this page:

    @public.route('/docs/<doc_name>.md')
    def document_docs(doc_name):
        return render_markdown('docs/', doc_name)
    
    def render_markdown(path, doc_name):
        import markdown2
        with open(ROOT + 'templates/' + path + doc_name + '.md', 'r') as mdf:
            return render_template('documentation.html', title=doc_name,
                markdown=markdown2.markdown(mdf.read(), use_file_vars=True))
        return 'Not Found', 404
